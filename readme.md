# Marvel Characters Project

This project is a JavaScript application created for educational purposes. It asynchronously fetches and organizes Marvel character information, allowing users to search for specific characters.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JSON
- JavaScript

### JavaScript Concepts Applied:

1. **Asynchronous Programming:**

   - Asynchronous data fetching is achieved using `async` and `await`.

2. **Fetch API:**

   - Data is fetched from an external source using the `fetch` API.

3. **HTML and DOM Manipulation:**

   - JavaScript manipulates HTML and the Document Object Model (DOM) to create the user interface.

4. **Data Formatting and String Operations:**

   - Various methods are employed for data formatting and string operations (`padStart`, `replace`, etc.).

5. **Event Listening (Event Handling):**
   - Dynamic search functionality is implemented by listening for the `input` event when the user searches.

## Marvel Data Structure

Information about Marvel characters is stored in the `marvel.json` file.
